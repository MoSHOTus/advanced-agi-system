# Advanced AGI System

This project implements an advanced Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system with a web interface for interaction and visualization.

**Note: All code in this project was generated and is being edited by an AI assistant.**

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On Unix or MacOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
4. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the System

To run the system, including both the comprehensive tests and the web interface, execute:

```
python main.py
```

This will start the system tests in one thread and the web interface in another. You can access the web interface by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:5000`.

## Components

- **Cognitive Architecture**: The core AGI system implementation.
- **System Tester**: Comprehensive tests for the AGI system.
- **Web Interface**: A Flask-based web application for interacting with the AGI system and visualizing its state and outputs.

## Web Interface Features

- Query input for text-based interactions with the AGI system
- File upload for processing images or other supported file types
- Visualization of system stats, knowledge graphs, and emotional indicators
- Display of processed results and extracted concepts

To use the web interface, enter your query in the text area, optionally upload a file, and click "Process Query". The results will be displayed in various sections of the interface.

## AI-Generated Code

It's important to note that all the code in this project, including this README file, has been generated and is being maintained by an AI assistant. This project serves as an example of AI-driven software development and showcases the capabilities of advanced language models in creating complex software systems.
