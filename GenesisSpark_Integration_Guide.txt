Title: Integration Guide for GenesisSpark in EnhancedCognitiveSystem

Description:
This document describes the `GenesisSpark` class, an AI component designed for generating, evaluating, and selecting creative hypotheses and associative ideas. It integrates with the `EnhancedCognitiveSystem`, enabling the AI to propose and test innovative concepts autonomously.

---

### GenesisSpark Class Definition

The `GenesisSpark` class is intended to enable creative reasoning within the system by leveraging connections and conceptual links in `KnowledgeGraph`. It functions as a hypothesis generator, evaluator, and selector, with outputs aimed at enhancing the system's problem-solving capabilities.

```python
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Any
from .agi_core import KnowledgeGraph, TextProcessor, ImageProcessor

class GenesisSpark:
    """GenesisSpark: Hypothesis and association generator to foster creative AI thinking."""

    def __init__(self, knowledge_graph: KnowledgeGraph, text_processor: TextProcessor, image_processor: ImageProcessor):
        self.knowledge_graph = knowledge_graph
        self.text_processor = text_processor
        self.image_processor = image_processor
        self.hypothesis_log = []

    def generate_hypothesis(self, concept_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Creates a new hypothesis using associative links based on the given concept_id.
        :param concept_id: ID of the origin concept to base the hypothesis on
        :return: Dictionary containing hypothesis details and proposed connections.
        """
        similar_concepts = self.knowledge_graph.find_similar_concepts(self.knowledge_graph.concepts[concept_id].embedding, k=5)
        neighborhood = self.knowledge_graph.get_concept_neighborhood(concept_id, max_depth=2)
        
        hypothesis = {
            "origin": concept_id,
            "related_concepts": similar_concepts,
            "neighborhood_structure": neighborhood,
            "timestamp": datetime.now()
        }

        self.hypothesis_log.append(hypothesis)
        return hypothesis

    def analyze_hypothesis(self, hypothesis: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
        """
        Evaluates the hypothesis by forming associative suggestions for concepts.
        :param hypothesis: Hypothesis generated in generate_hypothesis
        :return: Analysis report summarizing hypothesis evaluation
        """
        related = hypothesis["related_concepts"]
        analysis_report = "Hypothesis based on concept {}, proposing connections to: {}
".format(
            hypothesis["origin"], ", ".join([rel[0] for rel in related])
        )

        hypothesis["analysis"] = analysis_report
        return analysis_report

    def refine_ideas(self, initial_concept: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """
        Generates several variations of new ideas based on an initial concept.
        :param initial_concept: ID of the origin concept
        :return: List of new idea variations
        """
        idea_variants = []
        for i in range(3):
            idea = self.generate_hypothesis(initial_concept)
            self.analyze_hypothesis(idea)
            idea_variants.append(idea)
        return idea_variants

    def select_best_idea(self, ideas: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Evaluates and selects the best idea.
        :param ideas: List of ideas generated by refine_ideas
        :return: Best idea based on analysis results
        """
        best_idea = max(ideas, key=lambda idea: len(idea["related_concepts"]))
        return best_idea
```

### Integration Steps in EnhancedCognitiveSystem

1. **Initializing GenesisSpark**: Instantiate `GenesisSpark` within the `EnhancedCognitiveSystem` class.
2. **Method Integration**:
   - Add methods such as `generate_hypothesis`, `analyze_hypothesis`, and `refine_ideas` to enable hypothesis generation and selection within the cognitive system.
3. **Testing and Evaluation**: Use various scenarios to validate the functionality of `GenesisSpark` (outlined below).

```python
class EnhancedCognitiveSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.knowledge_graph = KnowledgeGraph()
        self.text_processor = TextProcessor()
        self.image_processor = ImageProcessor()
        self.genesis_spark = GenesisSpark(self.knowledge_graph, self.text_processor, self.image_processor)

    def explore_creative_ideas(self, concept_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Initiates a creative process to generate hypotheses and select the best ideas.
        :param concept_id: ID of the concept to initiate the process
        :return: The best idea generated by GenesisSpark
        """
        ideas = self.genesis_spark.refine_ideas(concept_id)
        best_idea = self.genesis_spark.select_best_idea(ideas)
        return best_idea
```

### Virtual Testing Scenarios

To ensure effective functionality, `GenesisSpark` should be tested under these scenarios:

1. **Scenario 1: Exploring Text-Based Hypotheses for "AI_Ethics"**
   - **Objective**: Generate and validate hypotheses based on "AI_Ethics."
   - **Steps**:
      1. `GenesisSpark` extracts similar concepts from `KnowledgeGraph`.
      2. Generates and analyzes hypotheses around ethical and technical aspects.
   - **Expected Outcome**: Relevant ethical connections identified for further research.

2. **Scenario 2: Cognitive Combination of Textual and Visual Data for "Environmental_Impact"**
   - **Objective**: Integrate visual and textual data related to "Environmental_Impact."
   - **Expected Outcome**: Finds associations linking "Environmental_Impact" with "Sustainable_Technologies."

3. **Scenario 3: Memory-Driven Hypotheses for Sequential Concept Development**
   - **Objective**: Use episodic memory to develop ideas on "Historical_AI_Development."
   - **Expected Outcome**: Sequential ideas demonstrate progression from historical to modern AI.

4. **Scenario 4: Generating Alternative Solutions for Explainable AI (XAI)**
   - **Objective**: Propose hypotheses on "Explainability" through diverse approaches.
   - **Expected Outcome**: New explainability concepts, combining both visual and textual aspects of XAI.

5. **Scenario 5: Dynamic Creation of Concepts for AI-Augmented Creativity**
   - **Objective**: Generate concepts supporting "AI-Augmented Creativity."
   - **Expected Outcome**: New concepts expand AI's creativity-supporting capabilities.
